# This is the Arduino based Sensor based robot which uses sensor, servo motor, microcontroller, etc. It's working is
this robot basically sense garbage and opens dustbin cap, this robot senses garbage or any other object with the help
Ultrasonic Sensor.

# Ultrasonic sensor consist of two parts transmitter and reciver. Transmitter shot's out ultrasonic waves whic later hits
object if present if front and comes back by reflecting, which is recived by reciver part.

# By this continious In and Out process Ultrasonic sensor calculates distance between sensor and object if present, then sensor sends 
signal to microcontroller(Arduino), which later tells Servo motor when to open or close the cap of dustbin.

# This is basic working principle of Arduino based obstacle avoiding robot:)
